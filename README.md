# ASCII Art Project


In this project we have used ASCII characters(like @,$,u,&,*...etc.) available on our keyboard to create images just from these characters. 
As an additional task, **videos as well as live webacam feed** have also been turned into coloured ASCII video. An extra feature that has been added is, we can also change the *style of ASCII characters, background, frame size* in our running video/feed. 

So let's look at this Another Super Cool Interesting Idea(ASCII) for image and video conversion.
